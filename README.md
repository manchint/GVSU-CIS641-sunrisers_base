# SUNRISERS

we are proposing “The Cook Book”, a modern recipe sharing website, which aims to provide users with a variety of food recipes from healthy to various gourmet, super quick to fine culinary dishes with the ingredients available to the user.A user can register on the website and can browse through a variety of recipes with the help of the powerful search feature with sorting and filtering, user can retrieve recipes based on the ingredients provided, user can like a recipe, provide comments and reviews on recipes and upload own recipes and contribute to the system. A user can also filter out the recipes based on the number of likes. 

The website does not just make cooking easier, faster, and convenient but also gives users an opportunity to share their culinary experience with others.
