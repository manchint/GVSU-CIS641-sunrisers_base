# Introduction

Cooking is an art; turning an ordinary meal into a fine culinary dish or turning a healthy snack into a lip-smacking snack is all about knowing the right recipe with the right ingredients. However, in a busy schedule searching for the right recipes of choice based on the ingredients available in the kitchen is a time-consuming job. 

Hence we are proposing “The Cook Book”, a modern recipe sharing website, which aims to provide users with a variety of food recipes from healthy to various gourmet, super quick to fine culinary dishes with the ingredients available to the user.  

A user can register on the website and can browse through a variety of recipes with the help of the powerful search feature with sorting and filtering, user can retrieve recipes based on the ingredients provided, user can like a recipe, provide comments and reviews on recipes and upload own recipes and contribute to the system. A user can also filter out the recipes based on the number of likes. Food is not just about taste; it is also about its nutritional value thus each recipe contains its nutritional details, so that the user can identify meals according to their calorie intake and add them to their regular diet and meal preps plan. 

The website does not just make cooking easier, faster, and convenient but also gives users an opportunity to share their culinary experience with others. 


# Anticipated Technologies

Below are the technologies that would be used to implement the project:

 __Front end:__  React,html,css
 
__Backend:__ Spring boot(spring rest,data jpa,actuator, jms)

__Database:__ Mysql

# Method/Approach

We are planning on using the Agile method where initially we list down all the features which we are planning to develop. Initially We are planning to start by designing the Database and finalize the ER model.After we are planning to start work on the Backend API by Identifying the format for the Request and the Response. Along with Backend we will also work on UI designing and the development as it doesn’t have any dependencies and Finally we are planning to integrate the API with the UI. We are planning to  write the test case and test the feature against these test cases.We are planning to repeat this process for each and every feature. We are planning to do regression testing after every feature so that we can avoid any regression issues and fix them.

# Estimated Timeline

We are planning to have milestones which will help us track the progress of the entire project. 
We decided to make every feature as one individual Milestone and each Milestone will have subtasks like UI, Backend, Integration, Testing. Here are the few milestones which we have identified so far based on our project plan.
- Login Screen
- SignUp Screen
- Logout Screen
- Home Screen 

    -> List of Recipe

    ->Filter to get the Recipe based on the Item we searched

    -> Like Button

    -> Comment box

    ->Adding new food item
- Testing

We planned to have the Milestones completed based on the order mentioned above and we are confident that we will be finishing up our proiect before the deadline.


# Anticipated Problems
## * Meeting/ Coordinating
    Have a scheduled meeting every week which works for all the people on the team
    
## * What to Work On?
    Dividing the tasks in the meetings making sure that everyone gets chance to work on different technology and also making sure to work on what is comfortable
    
## * Meeting Deadline
    Having regular checkpoints/ Milestones at different points on the project to ensure that project is making progress and meeting the deadlines
    
## * Conflicts
    Constantly communicating with all the team members making sure that everyone is on the same page
    
## * Dependencies
    Identifying the dependecies and assigning the tasks accordingly so that no team member is blocked from other teammates work
  
## * Verification / Validation
    Validating the features against the test cases regularly to avoid any kind of regression
